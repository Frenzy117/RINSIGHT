Record audio over WiFi by changing IP address in the v0.3 OSSG board to the IP of the laptop you are using as a server that is on the same wifi network as the OSSG board.

## Record

Run `server.py`:
```
python3 server.py
```

## Playback

Use ffplay to play the 16000Hz, 16bit raw PCM encoded audio data:
```
ffplay -f s16le -ar 16000 -ac 1 curr_audio.raw
```
